#### Study Helper

- **Description:** Helps the user focus on the task at hand and provides points for doing so.

- **Mobile:** The device will more than likely be with the user most of the day.(TODO)
- **Category:** Productivity/Education(?TODO)
- **Story:** Built to help limit the distractions that come from the device, but allows some distractions if granted, things like emergency texts/phone calls(Filtered to specific names, if that can be done.) 
- **Market:** Those who struggle to keep their attention on the task at hand.
- **Habit:** Hopefully encourages those that get distracted easily to break the habit. (Quicker times get more points?Qwerk in the idea...)
- **Scope:** V1 would be the implementation of the timer to get the assignment done. V2 would be the implementation of the distraction blocker. V3 would be the point system and the ability to spend it on something. (No clue.)

### Background/Idle game

- **Category:** Entertainment
- **Market:** To people who are bored and want a quick game as a distraction.

 (Should we have a timer/ clock for the games so that if they need to go somewhere.Just a random utility.)
